it will run one by one

________________________________________________________________________________________________
     HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every 
TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. HTTP is a network 
delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads 
faster.
